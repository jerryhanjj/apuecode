## Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment

### Overview
- code for book
- notes for study
- record for memory

### For me
Writing down each example with my own hands helps me remember it better, even if it's actually the same as the source code.

### Build
The third edition of this book has some differences between the two before. It's not complicated.
